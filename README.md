# Advanced Lane Finding
> An image processing pipeline to identify lane boundaries

## INTRODUCTION
The goal of this project is to write a software pipeline that identifies the lane boundaries in a video taken from a front-facing camera on a car.

This project was undertaken as part of the [Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).
